	config NETLOGGING_USE_RINGBUFFER
		bool "Use xRingBuffer as IPC"
		default n
		help
			Use xRingBuffer as IPC instead of xMessageBuffer.
			Both xMessageBuffer and xRingBuffer are interprocess communication (IPC) components provided by ESP-IDF.
			Several drivers provided by ESP-IDF already use xRingBuffer.
			This project uses xMessageBuffer by default.
			If you use this project at the same time as a driver that uses xRingBuffer, using xRingBuffer may save some memory.
			Memory usage status can be checked with idf.py size-components.

	config NETLOGGING_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH
		int "Max message length"
		default 256
		help
			Set the maximum message length.
			Note: This is the maximum length of a single log message.
			Make sure to set this value according to your needs.
			For example, if you expect to log large messages, you may want to increase this value.
			Conversely, if you are concerned about memory usage, you may want to decrease this value.

	config NETLOGGING_BUFFER_SIZE
		int "Buffer size"
		default 1024
		help
			Set the buffer size for logging.
			Note: This is the size of the buffer used for logging messages.
			Make sure to set this value according to your needs.
			For example, if you expect to log large messages, you may want to increase this value.
			Conversely, if you are concerned about memory usage, you may want to decrease this value.

	config NETLOGGING_CUSTOM_SSE_ASSETS
		bool "Use a custom index.html asset for the built-in HTTP SSE Loggging Server"
		default n
		help
			Enable this to provide a customized version of index.html to be included in the built-in HTTP SSE Loggging Server.
			The file must be provided by your project. See examples/sse_server for how to do it.
